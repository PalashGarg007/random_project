# Dynamic programming
import timeit
""" Dynamic Programming is mainly used when solutions of the same subproblems
    are needed again and again. In dynamic programming, computed solutions to
    subproblems are stored in a table so that these donâ€™t have to be
    recomputed. So Dynamic Programming is not useful when there are no common
    (overlapping) subproblems because there is no point storing the solutions
    if they are not needed again.
