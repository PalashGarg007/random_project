    Now, let us discuss the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem as an
    example problem that can be solved using Dynamic Programming.

    The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of
    the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the
    subsequence are sorted in increasing order.
